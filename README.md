# simpledjangoinv
This is a simple CRUD app for logging inventory that I built from scratch to practice using Django.
After following Youtube tutorials to make some simple Django apps, I wanted to make something from scratch
without using any guides in order to consolidate my knowledge of the basics of Django. 

This app allows you to create, read, edit and delete entries in an SQL database. Concerning the views, I
decided to use primarily class-based views in order to familiarise myself with the generic patterns, with 
some function based views to practice those also. 

I also used bootstrap to add some basic CSS to beautify the app and crispyforms to help handle the create
and update forms. I also used the Django REST API framework so that users can obtain JSON data directly
from a site URL.

This app taught me a great deal about the basics of Django and forced me to work though and debug many
problems by myself. Deploying the app to Heroku also taught me about the steps necessary to deploy an app online.

This app has also been uploaded to Heroku and can be viewed at https://djangoinventoryslupepe.herokuapp.com/
